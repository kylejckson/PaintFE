# cargo-audit configuration
# These advisories are acknowledged: all are "unmaintained" crate warnings
# (no known exploits or CVEs). They are all transitive dependencies that
# cannot be removed without major version bumps of eframe, wgpu, rfd, or
# imagepipe. They will be resolved when those dependencies are next upgraded.
